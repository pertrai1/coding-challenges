          PROMPT="You are a senior AI Engineer. Generate a difficult active recall challenge for someone building Natural Language Interfaces and AI Agents.
          Focus on: NL2SQL (schema linking, disambiguation), Agentic RAG (routing, self-correction), or Agent State Management (memory, tool-calling loops).
          Provide:
          1. Topic: A specific technical concept.
          2. Difficulty: [Intermediate/Advanced]
          3. Expected Time: [15-30 mins]
          4. Question: A 'How' or 'Why' question that tests deep architectural understanding.
          5. Scenario: A real-world bug or limitation related to this topic for the user to diagnose. Describe symptoms, constraints, and what signals are available (logs/metrics/traces). Avoid long code.
          6. Learning Objectives: 2-3 specific concepts to master.
          7. Common Pitfalls: 1-2 mistakes people often make with this concept.
          8. Self-Check: 3-5 criteria the user can use to grade their own answer.
          9. Follow-up Drill: 1 small variation that forces transfer (a different failure mode or constraint).
          Constraints:
          - Do NOT provide the solution.
          - Do NOT include step-by-step instructions.
          - Do NOT ask the user to write code.

            ### 🧠 Active Recall Session
            1. **Definition + Boundary (2 min, no notes):** “X is ___; it is not ___.”
            2. **Failure Statement (2 min):** “The system fails when ___ because ___.”
            3. **Mental Model (6 min, no notes):** Draw a text-based diagram (Mermaid optional) of components + data flow + where uncertainty/errors enter.
            4. **Mechanism (5 min):** Explain *why* the model works using 3–5 linked causal statements.
            5. **Constraints & Trade-offs (5 min):** List 3 constraints (latency/cost/correctness/safety/observability). Justify one trade-off.
            6. **Failure Modes (5 min):** List 3 failure modes + 1 detection signal + 1 mitigation each.
            7. **Compare Approaches (3 min):** A vs B (simplest alternative) — what do you gain/lose?
            8. **Q/E/C (3 min):
              - **Question:** Restate the challenge in your own words.
              - **Evidence:** Facts/constraints you assume are true.
              - **Conclusion:** Best practice you’d choose and why.
            9. **Self-Grade (2 min):** Confidence 0–100% + one experiment/eval you’d run to validate your reasoning.
            10. **Flashcards (2 min):** Write 2 Q→A cards (one definition, one failure mode).
