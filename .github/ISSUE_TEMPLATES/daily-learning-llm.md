## Active Recall (NO NOTES)

### 1. Definition + Boundary

**{{ env.CONCEPT }} is **_; it is not _**.**

(Define the concept from the paper in your own words without looking at the source)

---

### 2. Failure Statement

**The system/approach fails when **_ because _**.**

(What are the known limitations or failure modes discussed in the paper?)

---

### 3. Mental Model

```mermaid
# Reconstruct the system architecture, data flow, or conceptual framework
# Include: components, interactions, feedback loops, uncertainty points
```

(Alternative: ASCII diagram showing the mechanism)

---

### 4. Mechanism (Causal Chain)

(Write 3–5 linked causal statements explaining _why_ this approach works)

1. **Input/Trigger →**
2. **Process/Transform →**
3. **Intermediate Effect →**
4. **Feedback/Constraint →**
5. **Output/Result**

---

### 5. Constraints & Trade-offs

**Computational Constraints:**

- **Architectural Constraints:**

- **Alignment/Safety Constraints:**

- **Chosen trade-off and justification:**

  ***

### 6. Transfer Test

**Scenario:** How would this approach perform in:

- Different modality (code → images, text → audio)?
- Different scale (10x parameters, 100x data)?
- Different domain (medical, legal, scientific)?

**Prediction:**

**Failure hypothesis:**
