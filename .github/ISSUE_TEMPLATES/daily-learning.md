## Learning Objective

**Bucket:** {{ env.BUCKET }}  
**Focus:** {{ env.FOCUS }}  
**Date:** {{ env.DATE }}

(What system, concept, or failure surface am I reconstructing from memory?)

## Active Recall (NO NOTES)

### 1. Definition + Boundary

**X is **_; it is not _**.**

---

### 2. Failure Statement

**The system fails when **_ because _**.**

---

### 3. Mental Model

(Text diagram or Mermaid showing components, data flow, uncertainty, feedback)

---

### 4. Mechanism (Causal Chain)

(Write 3–5 linked causal statements explaining _why_ this works)

---

### 5. Constraints & Trade-offs

- Constraint 1:
- Constraint 2:
- Constraint 3:

**Chosen trade-off and justification:**

---

### 6. Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Detection Signal | Mitigation |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ---------- |
|              |                  |            |
|              |                  |            |
|              |                  |            |

---

### 7. Transfer Test

(How would this idea change in another domain or system?)

## Self-Assessment (Rubric)

| Dimension              | Score (0–4) | Notes |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| Conceptual Clarity     |             |       |
| Mental Model Integrity |             |       |
| Causal Understanding   |             |       |
| Failure Awareness      |             |       |
| Trade-off Judgment     |             |       |
| Transfer Ability       |             |       |
| Calibration & Honesty  |             |       |

**Initial Confidence (0–100%):** {{ env.CONFIDENCE }}

### Falsification Plan

(One experiment or eval that could prove me wrong)

---

### Carry-Forward Insight

(One sentence for Future Me)

---

### Delayed Recall (Fill Later)

- What did I forget?
- What was oversimplified?
- What was wrong?

---

### Completion Checklist

- [ ] Explained aloud without notes
- [ ] Identified ≥1 real failure mode
- [ ] Made a falsifiable claim
- [ ] Scored honestly
