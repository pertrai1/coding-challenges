# System Design Practice

A structured repository for practicing system design problems using repeatable templates.

## Structure

- **templates/** — Full, rapid, and cheat-sheet templates used to answer any system design question.
- **problems/** — Prompts for classic system design scenarios (Dropbox, Instagram, Twitter, etc.).
- **solutions/** — My worked solutions using both the full template and the rapid drill template.
- **assets/** — Optional folder for diagrams, architecture sketches, sequence diagrams.
- **practice-log/** — Daily/weekly reflections on what I practiced, what I learned, and what to revisit.

## How to Use

1. Pick a problem from `problems/`.
2. Choose either:
   - The **full worksheet** (for deep practice), or
   - The **rapid worksheet** (for speed drills).
3. Create a new folder in `solutions/` with:
   - `rapid.md` (10–15 min version)
   - `full.md` (full architecture version)
4. Add any diagrams to `assets/`.
5. Write a short reflection entry in `practice-log/`.

## Goals

- Build muscle memory for system design interviews.
- Learn to articulate constraints, tradeoffs, and architecture clearly.
- Develop templates that work for real engineering work as well.
