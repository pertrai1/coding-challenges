# [Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters) ![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-orange)

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return _the length of the longest **substring** of_ `s` _that contains at most_ `k` _**distinct** characters_.

## Example 1

```text
Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring is "ece" with length 3.
```

## Example 2

```text
Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring is "aa" with length 2.
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `0 <= k <= 50`
