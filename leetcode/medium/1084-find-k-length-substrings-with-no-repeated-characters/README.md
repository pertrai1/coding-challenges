# [Find K-Length Substrings With No Repeated Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-length-substrings-with-no-repeated-characters) ![Shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-orange)

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`,
return _the number of substrings in_ `s` _of length_ `k` _with no repeated characters_.

**Example 1:**

```bash
Input: s = "havefunonleetcode", k = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings they are: 'havef','avefu','vefun','efuno','etcod','tcode'.
```

**Example 2:**

```bash
Input: s = "home", k = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: Notice k can be larger than the length of s. In this case, it is not possible to find any substring.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= k <= 10^4`
