# [Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list-ii) ![Shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-orange)

Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, _delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list_. Return _the linked list **sorted** as well_.

## Example 1

```bash
Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
Output: [1,2,5]
```

## Example 2

```bash
Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3]
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The list is guaranteed to be _sorted_ in ascending order.
