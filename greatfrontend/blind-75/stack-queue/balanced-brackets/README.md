# Balanced Brackets

Given a string str consisting of characters such as `'(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']'`, determine if the input string is properly balanced.

A string is considered balanced if:

- Each opening bracket is closed by the same type of bracket (e.g., `(` with `)`, `{` with `}`, and `[` with `]`)
- Open brackets are closed in the correct order (e.g., `([])` is valid, but `([)]` is not)
- Any subset of brackets enclosed within a matched pair must also form a valid matched pair (e.g., `{[(])}` is not balanced because the contents inside `{` and `}` are unbalanced).

## Input

- `str: string`: A String

## Examples

```bash
Input: str = "[]"
Output: true
Explanation: The string contains correctly paired and ordered parentheses.

Input: str = "([)]"
Output: false
Explanation: The string contains correctly paired but incorrectly ordered parentheses.

Input: str = "([]){}"
Output: true
Explanation: The string contains correctly paired and ordered parentheses.
```

## Constraints

- 1 <= `str.length` <= 1000
- The string `str` contains only the characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[` and `]`
