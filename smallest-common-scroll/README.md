# The Great Scroll Hunt

Deep in the temple archives, three apprentices—Ada, Ren, and Jin—are tasked with finding a single scroll that appears in all three of their assigned sections. Each apprentice's section is sorted alphabetically, but they’re too lazy to compare everything manually. The scroll must be the **smallest common element** among their sections.

Write a function to find the smallest scroll (element) that appears in all three sorted arrays. If no such scroll exists, return -1 — and prepare to face Master Qu’s disapproving glare.

```javascript
scrolls_a = [2, 3, 5, 8, 10];
scrolls_b = [4, 5, 6, 10, 12];
scrolls_c = [1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15];

// 5
```
