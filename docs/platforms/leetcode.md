## 💡 Tips for LeetCode

1. **Read constraints carefully** - They often hint at the solution approach
2. **Start with brute force** - Then optimize
3. **Practice patterns** - Group similar problems together
4. **Time yourself** - Aim for 30-45 minutes per problem in practice
5. **Review solutions** - Even after solving, read top solutions
