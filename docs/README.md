## Data Structures and Algorithms Problem Solving Techniques

### Hash Lookup Technique

- Use hash-based data structures (Map, Set, Object) for O(1) average-case lookups, insertions, and deletions.
- Essential for: Two Sum pattern, frequency counting, duplicate detection, grouping, and memoization.
- **Map**: Key-value pairs with any data type as keys.
- **Set**: Unique values collection for membership testing.
- [Technique Details](techniques/HASH_LOOKUP.md)

### Sliding Window Technique

- Maintain a window over an array/string while expanding and shrinking based on constraints.
- Used for longest substring problems, frequency constraints, and streaming aggregates.
- [Technique Details](techniques/SLIDING_WINDOW.md)

### Two Pointers Technique

- Use two pointers to traverse data structures efficiently, eliminating nested loops.
- **Opposite Direction**: Pointers start at opposite ends and converge (e.g., Two Sum, palindrome checking).
- **Same Direction**: Pointers move in parallel at different speeds (e.g., remove duplicates, fast/slow cycle detection).
