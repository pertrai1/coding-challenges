## Data Structures and Algorithms Problem Solving Techniques

### Sliding Window Technique

- Maintain a window over an array/string while expanding and shrinking based on constraints.
- Used for longest substring problems, frequency constraints, and streaming aggregates.
- [Technique Details](techniques/SLIDING_WINDOW.md)

### Two Pointers Technique

- Use two pointers to traverse data structures efficiently, eliminating nested loops.
- **Opposite Direction**: Pointers start at opposite ends and converge (e.g., Two Sum, palindrome checking).
- **Same Direction**: Pointers move in parallel at different speeds (e.g., remove duplicates, fast/slow cycle detection).
- [Technique Details](techniques/TWO_POINTERS.md)
