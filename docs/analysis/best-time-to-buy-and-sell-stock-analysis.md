## Time Complexity

**Estimated:** O(n)
**Description:** Linear time - iterates through all prices
**Confidence:** 57.7%

> ⚠️ **Low Confidence**: Please manually verify this analysis.

## Space Complexity

**Estimated:** O(1)
**Reason:** Only two variables (`minPrice` and `maxProfit`) are used; no recursion or scalable data structures.

## Data Structures Used

- **Array**: []
  - access: O(1)
  - search: O(n)
  - insertion: O(1) amortized
  - deletion: O(n)

## Code Metrics

- **Lines of Code:** 9
- **Cyclomatic Complexity:** 2
- **Max Nesting Level:** 2

## Recommendations

- **VERIFICATION**: ⚠️ **Manual Review Needed**: Low confidence score suggests manual verification is required
